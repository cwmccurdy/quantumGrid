About
=====
quantumGrid is a package for solving a 1-D SchrÃ¶dinger equation for an
arbitrary potential on any interval. The heart of this package is using
a Finite Element Method with a Discrete Variable Representation
(FEM-DVR) grid to solve the time-dependent or time-independent
SchrÃ¶dinger equation. This grid provides a compact supported foundation
for numerically accurate integration and also allows for a natural
application of outgoing scattering boundary conditions by adding a complex
tail as the last finite element of the FEM-DVR grid, called *exterior
complex scaling* (ECS). Therefore, this grid can be applied to
scattering problems where the resonances become square integrable
under this complex rotation of the Hamiltonian.


Motivation
==========

This python package was created for a graduate course in time-dependent
quantum mechanics at UC Davis. Given the generality and usefulness of a
Finite Element Method - Discrete Variable Representation (FEM-DVR) grid
for solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation and simple scattering problems, we
wanted to go open source and provide this numerical tool for others in
the name of science!
