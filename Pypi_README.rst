About
=====

Exterior Complex Scaled Finite-Element Element Discrete Variable
Representation grid for general physics problems. In other words,
quantumGrid is a package for solving a 1-D Schrödinger equation
for an arbitrary potential.

Motivation
==========

This python package was created for a graduate course in time-dependent
quantum mechanics at UC Davis. Given the ease of programming in python,
generality and usefulness of a Finite Element Method - Discrete
Variable Representation (FEM-DVR) grid for solving the Schrödinger
equation and simple scattering problems, we wanted to go open source
and provide this numerical tool for others in the name of science!
